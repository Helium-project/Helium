## What is Helium

Helium is a framework that provides you with everything you need to develop modern web applications. It is a combination of frontend and backend functionality, allowing you to develop applications without unnecessary complications.

Helium is aimed at creating simple and easy-to-use web applications

### Main advantages

* **Simplicity and Convenience**: Helium provides tools that simplify development without overwhelming you with unnecessary details.

* **Intuitive Routing**: Helium provides a routing system based on directory organization. This allows you to easily structure your routing, making the navigation process more logical and clear.

## How to use

*Actual only at the time of ALPHA version of the framework, the process will be greatly simplified in the future!*

Download and unzip `helium-create-app`, this repository acts as the framework structure

Since Helium is not currently available as an npm package, you can download it to your device and connect it to [**helium-create-app**](https://github.com/ShizzaHo/helium-create-app) as a directory link via ```npm link %path_to_helium%```.

After that type ```npm install``` to install the dependencies, do this in both the **Helium** kernel and **helium-create-app**

Then you can use the ```npm start`` command to start the project.

## How it works

The **Helium** core is based on the **Express.js** library, providing a robust and efficient framework for developing your web applications. This means you get all the power and flexibility of **Express.js**, complemented by the unique features provided by **Helium**.

A key feature is intuitive routing, you can organize routes as directories, which makes the structure of your application more logical and easy to navigate. For example, creating a new page in your application will be associated with the creation of a new directory containing the corresponding component, style and data files.
